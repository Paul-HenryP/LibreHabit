### Permissions Explained

LibreHabit is designed to work offline, but it requires one permission for an optional feature:

*   **`android.permission.INTERNET`**
    *   **Purpose:** This permission is used **exclusively** for the "Check for Updates" feature in the settings menu.
    *   **How it works:** When you tap the button, the app makes a single, anonymous request to the GitHub API to see if a new release tag exists.
    *   **Privacy Guarantee:** This feature is **optional and user-initiated**. No personal data, analytics, or usage information is ever collected or transmitted. Your data never leaves your device.


## Installation
You can download the latest version from the GitHub Releases page.
Simply download the .apk file and install it on your Android device.

## Philosophy
- **Libre**: Free as in freedom. No ads, no lock-in.
